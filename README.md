# Zomato data analysis
 Data analysis of the Zomato dataset in the city of Gorakhpur.



Despite increasing demand, it has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established ones. With such an overwhelming demand for restaurants, it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location.

The key issues that continue to challenge them include high real estate costs, rising food costs, shortage of quality manpower, fragmented supply chain, and over-licensing. With data analytics, the project also will help people in choosing a restaurant based on several factors.

This project will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost, locality, etc for a particular location.

“Just so that you have a good meal the next time you step out”

The basic objective of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to gather insights about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurants at different places in Gorakhpur.

This project aims at exploring the demography, consumer behavior, and food culture of the city. And what factors should be kept in mind if someone wants to open a new restaurant?
